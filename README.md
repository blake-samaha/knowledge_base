# CDF Solution Engineering Knowledge Base

This repository contains a collection of best practices, lessons learned, and a sophisticated template framework for designing and implementing data solutions on Cognite Data Fusion (CDF).

## Purpose

The primary goal of this knowledge base is to standardize and accelerate the solution engineering process for CDF projects. It provides a structured, repeatable methodology for moving from initial business requirements to a fully specified, deployable solution architecture.

The framework is designed to be used collaboratively by:
- **Business Stakeholders & Subject-Matter Experts (SMEs):** To define business context and domain knowledge.
- **Solution Architects (SAs):** To design the data model and the end-to-end data flow.
- **AI Assistants:** To automate the generation of documentation, specifications, and the final deployable CDF Toolkit configuration files.

## Framework Templates

The core of this knowledge base is the template framework located in the `/templates` directory.

- **[Go to the Framework Templates](./templates/README.md)**

These templates guide users through a multi-stage process, ensuring that all critical aspects of a data solution—from governance and security to data lineage and transformations—are captured in a structured, machine-readable format.
