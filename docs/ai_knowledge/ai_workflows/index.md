## üöÄ Code Generation Workflows

### React Component Generation

**Context Setup**:
1. Open your `.cursor/rules.md` with React patterns
2. Have existing components open for reference
3. Include your component library or design system

**Prompt Structure**:
```
Create a React component for [component name] that:
- Accepts [props] as parameters
- Displays [specific content/functionality]
- Uses [styling approach] for styling
- Includes [specific features like validation, error handling]
- Follows our project's patterns for [specific aspect]

Requirements:
- [Specific business requirements]
- [Performance considerations]
- [Accessibility requirements]
- [Testing considerations]
```

**Example**:
```
Create a ProductCard component that:
- Accepts a product object with name, price, image, and description
- Displays the product information in a card layout
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Includes loading states and error handling
- Follows our project's patterns for TypeScript interfaces

Requirements:
- Must be responsive (mobile-first)
- Include hover effects for better UX
- Support dark mode
- Be accessible with proper ARIA labels
```

### API Endpoint Generation

**Context Setup**:
1. Open your API structure and patterns
2. Include database schemas or models
3. Have authentication/authorization patterns visible

**Prompt Structure**:
```
Create a [HTTP method] endpoint for [resource] that:
- Handles [specific operations]
- Validates [input requirements]
- Returns [expected response format]
- Includes [error handling, logging, etc.]
- Follows our API patterns for [specific aspect]

Database operations:
- [Specific database queries/operations]
- [Transaction handling if needed]
- [Data validation rules]

Security considerations:
- [Authentication requirements]
- [Authorization checks]
- [Input sanitization]
```

**Example**:
```
Create a POST endpoint for user registration that:
- Handles new user creation with email and password
- Validates email format and password strength
- Returns user data with JWT token
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- Follows our API patterns for response formatting

Database operations:
- Check if email already exists
- Hash password using bcrypt
- Create user record with timestamps
- Use database transaction for atomicity

Security considerations:
- Require valid JWT for authenticated endpoints
- Validate input against XSS and injection attacks
- Rate limit registration attempts
```

## üîç Debugging Workflows

### Error Analysis Workflow

**Context Setup**:
1. Open the file with the error
2. Include related files and dependencies
3. Have error logs or stack traces visible

**Prompt Structure**:
```
I'm getting this error: [paste error message]

Context:
- File: [file path]
- Function: [function name]
- Related files: [list of related files]

The error occurs when: [describe when it happens]

I've tried: [list attempted solutions]

Please help me:
1. Identify the root cause
2. Suggest a fix
3. Explain why this happened
4. Suggest prevention strategies
```

**Example**:
```
I'm getting this error: "Cannot read property 'name' of undefined"

Context:
- File: src/components/UserProfile.tsx
- Function: renderUserInfo
- Related files: src/types/User.ts, src/hooks/useUser.ts

The error occurs when: The user data hasn't loaded yet but the component tries to render

I've tried: Adding a loading check but it's still happening

Please help me:
1. Identify the root cause
2. Suggest a fix
3. Explain why this happened
4. Suggest prevention strategies
```

### Performance Debugging Workflow

**Context Setup**:
1. Open the problematic component/function
2. Include performance metrics or profiling data
3. Have related dependencies visible

**Prompt Structure**:
```
I'm experiencing performance issues with [component/function]:

Symptoms:
- [Describe the performance problem]
- [When it occurs]
- [ Impact on user experience]

Current implementation:
- [Brief description of current approach]
- [Key code sections]

Performance data:
- [Any metrics, profiling results, or observations]

Please help me:
1. Identify performance bottlenecks
2. Suggest optimization strategies
3. Provide optimized code examples
4. Recommend monitoring approaches
```

## üîß Refactoring Workflows

### Code Cleanup Workflow

**Context Setup**:
1. Open the file to be refactored
2. Include coding standards and patterns
3. Have similar well-structured files visible
