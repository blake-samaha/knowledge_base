# Context Engineering

Context engineering is the strategic discipline of designing and building dynamic systems that provide AI assistants with the right information, in the right format, at the right time. It's the foundation of effective AI-assisted development.

## üéØ What is Context Engineering?

While **prompt engineering** focuses on crafting the perfect instructions for a single request-response cycle, **context engineering** governs the selection, compression, memory, and tool schemas for an entire workflow.

### Key Distinction
- **Prompt Engineering**: "How do I ask the question?"
- **Context Engineering**: "What does the AI need to know before I even ask the question?"

## üèóÔ∏è The Three Tiers of Context

### Tier 1: Project-Level Context (Global Blueprint)
**Purpose**: Define the overall project environment and standards

**Contents**:
- Technology stack and specific versions
- Overarching architectural patterns
- Core design principles and coding standards
- Code organization and folder structure
- Naming conventions and workflows

**Implementation**: Store in `.cursor/rules.md` file in project root

### Tier 2: Feature-Level Context (Local Schematic)
**Purpose**: Provide information relevant to a specific feature or module

**Contents**:
- Related component interfaces
- API schemas and data models
- State management patterns
- Relevant test files and documentation

**Implementation**: Have relevant files open in editor or use `@file` references

### Tier 3: Task-Level Context (Immediate Instruction)
**Purpose**: Provide specific details for a single, immediate action

**Contents**:
- Specific implementation goal
- Acceptance criteria
- Performance requirements
- Environment compatibility needs

**Implementation**: Include directly in the prompt or chat message

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation in Cursor IDE

### 1. Project-Level Context (`.cursor/rules.md`)
```markdown
# Project Rules for AI Assistant

## Technology Stack
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript 5.2
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Prisma for database access
- Jest for testing

## Coding Standards
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use conventional commit messages

## Architecture Patterns
- Feature-based folder structure
- API routes in `/api` directory
- Database models in `/prisma` directory
- Shared utilities in `/lib` directory
```

### 2. Feature-Level Context
- Open relevant files in the editor
- Use `@file` references to include specific files
- Reference documentation and schemas

### 3. Task-Level Context
- Be specific about the immediate goal
- Include acceptance criteria
- Specify performance requirements

## üìà Benefits of Context Engineering

### Reduced Refactoring
When AI assistants understand project architecture upfront, developers report **60-80% reduction** in manual code refactoring time.

### Accelerated Debugging
With system-level context, debugging shifts from reactive symptom-chasing to proactive root-cause analysis.

### Enhanced Consistency
Centralized context ensures all developers and AI assistants build to the same standards, leading to more uniform, maintainable codebases.

### Improved Onboarding
New team members can leverage the same context as experienced developers, accelerating their productivity.

## üîÑ The Virtuous Cycle

Context engineering creates a positive feedback loop:

1. **Better Documentation** ‚Üí Forces teams to codify implicit knowledge
2. **Better AI Output** ‚Üí AI produces code that adheres to standards
3. **Better Developer Adherence** ‚Üí All developers follow established patterns
4. **Better Failure Analysis** ‚Üí Structured analysis identifies context gaps
5. **Even Better Documentation** ‚Üí Continuous improvement of shared knowledge

## üéØ Best Practices

### Start Simple
Begin with basic project-level context in `.cursor/rules.md` and gradually expand as needed.

### Be Specific
Include concrete examples, not just abstract principles. Show the AI exactly what you want.

### Keep Current
Regularly update context as your project evolves. Outdated context is worse than no context.

### Validate Results
Monitor AI outputs and refine context based on what works and what doesn't.

### Share Knowledge
Make context engineering a team practice. Share successful patterns and learn from failures.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Create `.cursor/rules.md`** in your project root
2. **Document your tech stack** and coding standards
3. **Include architectural patterns** and folder structure
4. **Add examples** of good code patterns
5. **Test and iterate** based on AI outputs
