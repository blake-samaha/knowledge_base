# CI/CD Integration

## Why CI/CD?

Automates validation, generation, and deployment, ensuring consistency in
docs-as-code workflows.

## Setting Up

Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

```yaml
name: CDF Docs-as-Code Pipeline
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Playbook
        run: python run_playbook.py
```

## Integrating Playbooks

Trigger playbooks on commits; example script:

```python
# run_playbook.py
print("Executing playbook...")
```
