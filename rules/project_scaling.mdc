# CDF Project Scaling and Portability

For general CDF project management:

- Break large projects into modules (e.g., separate pipelines from models).
- Use placeholders like {{project_id}} for generic configs.
- Implement exponential backoff for bulk ops and use upsert mode to avoid duplicates.
- In AI workflows, suggest modular code gen.
