This script will be responsible for synchronizing the high-level conceptual
data model with the detailed, object-level specifications.

TODO:
- Read the main conceptual_model.md for a module.
- Read all individual *_specification.md files for that module.
- Identify any discrepancies (e.g., an object in the conceptual model
  that does not have a corresponding spec file).
- (Optional) Automatically create placeholder spec files for missing objects.
