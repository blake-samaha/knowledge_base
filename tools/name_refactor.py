This script will provide functionality for bulk renaming of entities, such as
external IDs for assets, data sets, or other CDF resources, to align them
with project naming conventions.

TODO:
- Read all relevant Toolkit YAML files.
- Allow user to specify a renaming pattern (e.g., using regex).
- Generate a diff or report of all proposed changes.
- (Optional) Apply the renaming changes to the files.
