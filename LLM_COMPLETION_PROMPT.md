# LLM Prompt: Complete AI-Assisted Development Knowledge Base v1.0

You are an expert technical writer and AI-assisted development practitioner. You have been given a comprehensive knowledge base repository for AI-assisted development workflows and CDF deployment templates.

## Repository Context

**Read the README.md first** to understand the repository's dual purpose:
1. **Learning Path**: Progressive educational content for mastering AI-assisted development
2. **Production Templates**: Verified, production-tested templates for CDF deployments

The repository serves diverse audiences: project managers, software developers, CDF implementation teams, and advanced AI practitioners.

## Your Mission

Transform this repository from its current well-structured foundation into a complete **version 1.0** knowledge base with detailed, actionable content that enables immediate implementation of AI-assisted development techniques.

**CRITICAL**: This knowledge base will be deployed as **GitHub Pages using MkDocs**. Take whatever liberties you need to restructure the repository for optimal navigation, user experience, and logical content flow. The goal is a professional, browsable documentation site that serves all audiences effectively.

## Current State Analysis

The repository has:
- ✅ Professional MkDocs configuration with Material theme
- ✅ Clear navigation structure and organization
- ✅ Template files for CDF framework
- ✅ Basic content framework in place
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
- ✅ Comprehensive README with clear structure

**What's missing**: Detailed, practical examples and comprehensive content that makes the knowledge base immediately actionable.

## Repository Restructuring Guidelines

### Navigation-First Approach
- **Restructure for optimal browsing**: Organize content for GitHub Pages navigation
- **Logical user journeys**: Design paths for different user types (PMs, developers, CDF teams)
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as users dive deeper
- **Cross-references**: Create meaningful links between related content

### Suggested Structural Improvements
- **Consolidate related content**: Group similar topics together
- **Create landing pages**: Add overview pages for major sections
- **Add quick-start paths**: Create guided tours for different user types
- **Improve searchability**: Use clear titles, descriptions, and tags
- **Enhance visual hierarchy**: Use proper heading levels and navigation depth

### File Organization Principles
- **User-centric naming**: Use names that make sense to end users
- **Consistent patterns**: Follow similar structure across similar content types
- **Scalable architecture**: Design for future content additions
- **Clear separation**: Distinguish between learning content and production templates
